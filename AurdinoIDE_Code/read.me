# ESP32/Arduino Code for Ruya Project

This folder contains the Arduino/ESP32 sketches for the Ruya project, which control the gas sensor robot, handle sensor calibration, and send real-time readings to the WebApp dashboard.

## Files
- `arduinoide_sketch.ino` – Main Arduino sketch that reads gas sensor data, connects to Wi-Fi, and sends readings to the WebApp.
- `calibration_sketch.ino` – Sketch used for calibrating the gas sensor to ensure accurate PPM (parts per million) measurements.

## Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** installed on your computer.
- **ESP32 Board Support** added in Arduino IDE.
- ESP32 development board connected to your PC.
- Gas sensor (e.g., MQ-6) properly connected to the ESP32.
- Internet connection for the ESP32 to push readings to the WebApp or cloud backend.

## How to Set Up

### 1. Calibration
1. Open `calibration_sketch.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the gas sensor to the ESP32 according to the circuit.
3. Upload the sketch to your ESP32.
4. Follow instructions in the serial monitor to calibrate the sensor.
5. Note down calibration values if needed; these will be used in the main sketch.

### 2. Main Sketch
1. Open `arduinoide_sketch.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Enter your Wi-Fi credentials in the sketch (SSID and password).
3. Connect the gas sensor to the ESP32 as per the circuit.
4. Select the correct ESP32 board and COM port under **Tools → Board** and **Tools → Port**.
5. Click **Upload** to program the ESP32.

## How It Works
- The ESP32 reads analog values from the gas sensor and converts them to PPM using calibration values.
- Readings are sent via Wi-Fi to the WebApp or Firebase backend.
- Data can then be visualized in real-time on the WebApp dashboard.

## Notes
- Ensure the gas sensor is powered correctly and connected to the right pins.
- ESP32 must be connected to the internet for the WebApp to receive readings.
- Adjust the endpoint URLs in the sketches if your backend or WebApp URL changes.

## Dependencies
- Arduino IDE
- WiFi library (included with ESP32 board support)
- Optional: MQTT or HTTP library depending on your data push method
